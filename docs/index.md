# Node Manager

Manage multiple Ethereum nodes with Node Manager, 
a powerful tool that offers out-of-the-box features such as enhanced availability through redundancy or detailed usage statistics and control via a web-based interface. 

It is an HTTP proxy that handles Ethereum RPC calls and forwards them to connected Ethereum nodes. 
It can act as a highly capable Ethereum RPC endpoint. 
Written in Python, it can be run on any suitable machine, including virtualisation and Raspberry Pi.

Note: The Web3 Pi Node Manager is a tool that can be used to organize and manage access to Ethereum nodes configured based on Web3 Pi Node Setup, as well as any other Ethereum node.

*Web3 Pi Node Manager is in the Alpha version and some features are still under construction.*

**Next Steps**: [install](installation.md), [connect nodes](configuration.md#ethereum-nodes) and [manage access](admin.md).
