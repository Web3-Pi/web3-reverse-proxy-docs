# Web3-Pi Proxy

Manage multiple Ethereum nodes with Web3-Pi Proxy, 
a powerful tool that offers out-of-the-box features such as enhanced availability through redundancy or detailed usage statistics and control via a web-based interface. 

Basically, It is a http proxy to handle Ethereum RPC calls and forward them to connected Ethereum nodes.
Written in Python can be run on any capable machine, including virtualization and Raspberry-Pi.
So from the clients perspective it can act as a powerful Ethereum RPC endpoint.

Note that it is an optional element of Web3-Pi ifrastructure - 
it is used to organize and manage access to Web3-Pi and not Web3_pi Ethereum nodes.

Note that Web3-Pi proxy is in the Alpha version and some features are still under construction.
